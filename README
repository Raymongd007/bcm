Bayesian Committee Machine
Version 1.0, November 2005

The Bayesian Committee Machine (BCM) is an approximation method for
large-scale Gaussian process regression.

What you should know beforehand:

- The code is for Matlab

- It requires the Netlab toolbox. You can download Netlab from 
  http://www.ncrg.aston.ac.uk/netlab/

- Install Netlab *before* trying to run any of the programs here.

- To get started and to check your installation, try running 'dembcm.m'

- If you are looking for example code to run the BCM, have a look at dembcm.m
  All of the main features are used and explained there.
